# Eject Disks Alfred Extension

As is, this extension will eject all external disks using the keyword `eject`.

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) currently only allows you to eject entire volumes.

Once you install the script in Alfred, make sure you edit the second line so that `every disk` contains a list of the disks you want ejected when the script runs.

## Compatibility

This extension has only been tested on Alfred 2.0 that supports the `.alfredworkflow` file type.

## Assets

Icon: Eject - http://ionicons.com
