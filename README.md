# Eject Disks Alfred Extension

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) currently only allows you to eject entire volumes. I needed to eject a few partitions of a volume. This script is a quick workaround that'll let you do this.

Once you install the script in Alfred, make sure you edit the first line so that `volumeNames` contains a list of the partitions you want ejected when the script runs.

Hope this helps!
